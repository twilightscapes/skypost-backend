## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I don't have marketing assets yet"
- Use simple screenshots from the extension UI
- Create basic icon in Canva.com (free tier)
- Use placeholder text - you can update later

### "How do I take screenshots?"
- Firefox/Chrome: Press Cmd+Shift+4, select area
- Resize to required dimensions using Preview or online tool
- Safari: Same process

### "I'm not sure about the privacy policy"
- Skypost.app - create /privacy page
- Since extension stores locally: Simple policy is fine
- Example: "We don't collect data. Everything stays on your device."

### "Can I submit to all stores at the same time?"
- Yes! But recommend staggered for easier management
- Firefox is slow (1-5 days)
- Chrome is fast (1-3 hours)
- Safari is complex (needs manual setup)

### "What if one store rejects my submission?"
- They'll email you with specific reasons
- You can update and resubmit
- Usually just formatting or policy issues
- Read their feedback carefully and fix

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Submit Firefox First** - It's slow, so start it early
